/// <remarks>
/// The core store has its own merge, but it strips nulls first — it must, because a serialized CLR document
/// carries a null for every unset member, and treating those as deletions would wipe fields nobody touched.
/// An HTTP PATCH body is not a serialized document: every member in it was written by the caller, so an
/// explicit <c>null</c> means <b>remove</b>, exactly as RFC 7396 says. That difference is why this lives here
/// rather than being delegated.
